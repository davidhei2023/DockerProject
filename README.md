Welcome to my PolyBot Image Prediction Bot
Hello and welcome! PolyBot is a Telegram bot designed to help you analyze images and provide predictions based on advanced machine learning models. Follow the instructions below to start using PolyBot and see the magic happen!

How to Use PolyBot 
Connect to PolyBot on Telegram:

Open the Telegram app on your device.
Search for PolyBot or use the following link to connect: PolyBot Telegram Link (Replace # with your bot's link).
Upload a Photo:

Once connected, simply upload a photo that you want to analyze to the PolyBot chat.
Receive Predictions:

PolyBot will process your image using state-of-the-art machine learning models.
In a few moments, you'll receive a prediction along with an annotated image indicating the results.
Example
Here are some examples of the kind of predictions you can expect from PolyBot:

Before Prediction
(Insert a photo here showing the image before prediction)

After Prediction
(Insert a photo here showing the image with predictions and annotations)

What Happens Behind the Scenes
When you upload a photo to PolyBot, here's what happens behind the scenes:

Image Reception:

The image is sent to our server where it is processed by a Dockerized machine learning model.
Prediction Process:

The model analyzes the image using YOLO (You Only Look Once), a cutting-edge object detection algorithm.
The model predicts various elements within the image, such as objects, people, and other entities.
Annotated Image Generation:

The results are then used to generate an annotated image highlighting the detected objects and their respective labels.
Response to User:

The annotated image along with the prediction details are sent back to you via the Telegram bot.
Technical Details
Machine Learning Models: We use YOLOv5 for real-time object detection.
Infrastructure: The bot and the models are hosted using Docker containers for scalable and isolated environments.
Programming Languages: The backend is developed using Python, leveraging libraries such as PyTorch for machine learning.
